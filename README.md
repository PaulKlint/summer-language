# The SUMMER programming language

## What is here?
 
The language SUMMER was intended for the solution of problems in text processing and string manipulation. The language consists of a small kernel which supports success-directed evaluation, control structures, recovery caches and a data abstraction mechanism. This kernel can be extended to support simultaneous pattern matching in arbitrary domains.

## Current status

This repository contains -- as is -- all files as distributed for the PDP11 implementation of SUMMER and dates from 1984. No attempt has yet been made to compile and run thm.
