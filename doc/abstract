From SPRING to SUMMER:
design, definition and implementation of programming
languages for string manipulation and pattern matching.
.sp 8
.PP
This research is devoted to the design, definition and implementation
of programming languages for string processing and pattern matching.
It consists of two parts.
.PP
In the first part the problems with language concepts in existing
string processing languages are analyzed.
This analysis is based on experience with the language SPRING,
a first attempt in designing a string processing language.
Next, two language concepts are introduced that are as powerful
as the existing ones but do not exhibit the same, undesirable
properties:
a general mechanism for the control over side-effects that may occur
during a pattern match, and a notion of a "current focus of activity"
that allows, among other things, the definition of a current subject
string in a pattern match.
These two language concepts can be combined and form a very general pattern
matching model.
This model has been used in the design of the SUMMER programming language.
.PP
The second part contains a complete definition of the language
SUMMER.
This definition is based on an improved technique for formal, operational,
language definitions.
