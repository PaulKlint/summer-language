3. PROPOSALS FOR SEMINARS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
.PP
Here follow two proposals for seminars on the following two subjects:
.IP
language-independent programming environments, and
.IP -
programming languages and systems for string processing.
.LP
Each seminar is intended for students and professionals in the
area of computer science.
.PP
The outline of each seminar should be considered as a proposal:
depending on the available time and on the
background or interest of the audience certain subjects could
be added or removed from each seminar.

3.1. SEMINAR I: Language-independent programming environments
.PP
The construction of quality software is more and more becoming
a bottleneck for the production and dissemination of
information processing systems.
One approach to improve the quality of programs and the productivity
of programmers is to use \fIlanguage-dependent programming environments\fP,
i.e. systems dedicated to the construction and maintenance of programs
in \fIone\fP programming languages.
Such systems typically contain syntax-directed editors,
source-level debugging tools and tools for the management of
versions of software.
.PP
The development costs of such systems are, however, very high
and the number of programming languages in use is still increasing.
It is therefore economically attractive (and technically feasible)
to construct \fIlanguage-independent programming environments\fP,
which \fIgenerate\fP a language-dependent programming environment
on the basis of a formal definition of the desired language.
.PP
This series of five lectures (60 minutes each) is intended
for an audience with a general background in computer science
(i.e.  students and researchers in computer science)
and covers the following subjects:
.IP "a. Introduction"
.sp
Introduces basic terminology,
gives an overview of conventional systems and explores the
potentials for better integration of subsystems in a conventional system.
.IP "b. Language-dependent programming environments"
.sp
Gives an overview of the two major language-dependent programming
environments that exist today: INTERLISP and SMALLTALK.
.IP "c. A survey of language-independent programming environments"
.sp
Surveys and compares four major language-independent
systems: Mentor, The Synthesizer Generator,
Gandalf and CEYX.
.IP "d. Methods for formal language definition"
.sp
The specification given to a language-independent programming environment
is a formal definition of the desired programming language.
This lecture summarizes and compares methods for the definition
of lexical and concrete syntax and
of static and dynamic semantics.
.IP "e. An experimental language-independent programming environment"
.sp
Explains the philosophy and organisation of an experimental
language-independent programming environment that is currently
under development at the Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica in Amsterdam.
Other topics covered are: implementation techniques, current status
of the project and future directions and applications.

3.2. SEMINAR II: Programming languages and systems for string processing
.PP
Digital computers were originally invented for numeric computing.
Today one sees more and more applications of computers in the area
of non-numeric computing.
This is particularly clear for the systems for textprocessing
and office automation that are now coming into widespread use.
The development of such systems requires extensive knowledge
of string processing techniques and string processing languages.
.PP
This series of four lectures (75 minutes each) is intended
for an audience with a general background in computer science
(i.e.  students and researchers in computer science)
and covers the following subjects:
.IP "a. Introduction" 
.sp
Introduces the basic concepts and problems of string processing.
.IP "b. An overview of Icon"
.sp
Icon is a programming language developed at the University of Arizona
that provides very flexible control structures for string processing.
.IP "c. An overview of SUMMER"
.sp
SUMMER is a string processing developed by the author.
The language emphasizes the use of abstract datatypes (classes)
and side-effect recovery for string processing.
.IP "d. Architectures for string processing"
.sp
This lecture summarizes
the support for string processing given by conventional computers and
speculates on the question of selecting operations which should be built into the hardware.
