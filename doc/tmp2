The application of backtracking in pattern matching and the integration of
pattern matching operations into string processing languages form
the central themes of this chapter.
.PP
Backtracking can be used to solve
certain classes of pattern matching problems elegantly.
However, the effects of backtracking on the global program state are
often difficult to understand.
Are side-effects postponed until the
backtracking process as a whole has succeeded
(which restricts the class of problems that can be solved),
or are such modifications performed
immediately and undone on failure?
Several methods are being used to control the interaction between
the backtracking process and its side-effects.
Most methods have defects.
In this chapter an attempt will be made to improve on this state of affairs.
.PP
The analysis of backtracking will proceed in three stages.
First, in Section #{set of pm operators} some representative pattern matching functions and operators are defined.
These functions are sufficiently powerful that they exhibit the same problems
with regard to side-effects and backtracking as occur in, for example, \s-2SNOBOL\s04.
They are, at the same time, sufficiently simple to
allow a concise formal definition of their semantics and an analysis
of the problems at hand.
In other words, these functions are used to \fBmodel\fP
(i.e. imitate on a smaller scale) certain features of existing
programming languages.
.PP
Secondly, we have to choose a
method for describing the semantics of backtracking processes.
After comparing several methods found in the literature,
an improved description method is introduced, which is
based on operational semantics.
This is the subject of Section #{description methods}.
.PP
Thirdly, the description method is used to compare
two different pattern matching models.
In Section #{immediate/conditional model} the
\fBimmediate/conditional model\fP is described.
This is a generalization of the \s-2SNOBOL\s04 model [Griswold71].
In Section #{recovery model} the \fBrecovery model\fP is introduced.
This new model is based on the recovery block concept 
[Randell75]
which has been used for the construction of fault-tolerant software.
It is an attractive alternative to existing backtracking models,
since it combines simplicity and consistency with adequate expressive
power and ease of implementation.
.PP
Finally, Section #{unification} is devoted to the question of how pattern matching
and normal expression evaluation can be integrated and how
the domain of pattern matching can be extended beyond the domain of strings.
In the following chapters these ideas will be explored further.
